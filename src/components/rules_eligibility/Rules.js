        </b>
        You are not allowed to openly argue with a moderator about punishments.

          II. Forum Accounts

        </b>
        You are not allowed to share your account. Forum accounts are intended
        for the use by one person. You are not allowed to create backup accounts

          III. Remain on Topic
          <br />
        </b>
        Threads should remain on the topic that they are discussing, they should
        not be discussing other topics. A new thread should be made for a new
        discussion. Please do understand we are lenient upon this rule however
        if the topics gets majorly derailed we will take action.
        <br />

          IV. Inappropriate content
          <br />
        </b>
        Threads containing pornography, illegal content will be removed and the
        user banned. Racial, sexual, or any other form of discrimination is
        currently not tolerated. We are lenient depending upon the mannerism of
        discussion.

        <b>
          V. Flame or Provoke
          <br />
        </b>
        Do not continually and aggressively insult or flame other members of the
        forum. Similarly, do not post with the intention of provoking a reaction
        from fellow members. This includes encouraging flame wars.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
          V. Topic Setting
          <br />
        </b>
        The opening post of a thread sets the topic and the tone of the
        discussion. It should contain a member's opinions or questions with
        sufficient elaboration to establish a foundation for respectful
        discussion and debate. Images, links, quotations, etc., should be used
        to support a member's opinion, not to replace it.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
          VI. Topic Duplication
          <br />
        </b>
        Threads should not be posted in the wrong forum, or be duplicates of
        other threads and/or topics (creating multiple threads with
        fundamentally the same topic is not allowed, unless otherwise stated by
        a staff member).
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
          VII. Private Messaging
          <br />
        </b>
        Publicly post or otherwise share PMs with other users unless you have
        the expressed permission of the sender to do so. Private Messages are
        intended to be just that - private.
